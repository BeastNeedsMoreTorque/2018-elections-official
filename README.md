# 2018 Election Returns

This is the MEDSL repository for official returns for the 2018 Midterm Elections.

The `senate_overall_2018` and `district_overall_2018` datasets, containing constituency level U.S. Senate and U.S. House election returns, respectively, are official and complete (except in a few cases where updates will be made at a later time).

The `state_overall_2018` and `county_2018` datasets contain constituency level state office election returns and county level election returns for all offices, respectively.

The `precinct_2018` dataset contains precinct level election returns for all offices. It is incomplete but will be updated weekly until completion. The following (9) states are included in the dataset:

* Alabama
* Alaska
* Arkansas
* Colorado
* Connecticut
* Delaware
* Georgia
* Montana
* Wisconsin

The precinct data are a work in progress, and we welcome feedback. In particular, there are several discrepancies between the Alabama data and the precinct-level results (we are missing about 1000 votes in Chilton County, about 500 votes in Dallas County, and write-ins by precinct in Covington, Escambia, Lauderdale, Monroe, Pickens, and Russell Counties). If anyone has information on or knows where to find the missing votes, please let us know.
