This repository has been temporarily removed to investigate issues with duplicated rows and nearly duplicated rows. We are working to identify and correct the errors, which we have so far identified in the following states:

* ['Alabama', 'Alaska', 'Arizona', 'Connecticut', 'Florida', 'Illinois', 'Iowa', 'Kansas', 'Maryland', 'Michigan', 'Missouri', 'New Hampshire', 'New Jersey', 'Pennsylvania', 'Rhode Island', 'Vermont', 'Virginia', 'Wyoming']

We hope to provide corrected data shortly, and until we do so, data pulled from this repository prior to January 20, 2022 should be used with caution. Please contact us at sbaltz@mit.edu if you have any questions.
